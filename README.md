# Cyclistic-bike-share-analysis

## Introduction
Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study! In this case study, I am going to share my work for a
fictional company, Cyclistic, along with some key team members. In order to answer the business questions, I follow the steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process,
Analyze, Share, and Act.

## Scenario
As a junior data analyst on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago, my role is to contribute to understanding the different usage patterns between casual riders and annual members. Our director of marketing believes that the key to our company's future success lies in maximizing the number of annual memberships. To achieve this goal, our team is focused on uncovering insights into how these two groups of users utilize Cyclistic bikes differently. By analyzing this data, we aim to develop a new marketing strategy designed to convert casual riders into annual members. However, before we proceed with implementing this strategy, we need to present our recommendations to the Cyclistic executives. Therefore, our findings must be supported by compelling data insights and professional data visualizations to gain their approval.
## About the company
In 2016, Cyclistic launched its bike-share program, which has grown to a fleet of 5,824 geotracked bicycles across 692 stations in Chicago. The program offers flexible pricing plans, including single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Casual riders purchase single-ride or full-day passes, while annual memberships are held by Cyclistic members. Finance analysts have determined that annual members are more profitable than casual riders. Although flexible pricing attracts a wide range of customers, the marketing strategy has focused on broad awareness. To drive future growth, marketing director Moreno believes in converting casual riders, who are already familiar with Cyclistic, into annual members. The goal is to design targeted marketing strategies by understanding the differences between casual riders and annual members, why casual riders would convert to membership, and how digital media can support these efforts.
